<strong>About Me</strong>
<div style="margin-bottom:8px;"></div>
    <div>
      Hi! I’m Nellie. I’m a biomedical engineering master’s student at Georgia Tech (graduating December 2025), with a bachelor’s degree in biochemistry from Northeastern University (2021). I’m driven by a desire to use science to solve real-world problems—especially those that affect both human health and the health of our planet.
<div style="margin-bottom:8px;"></div>
      After three years working on genetic medicine at Eli Lilly, I began shifting my focus toward sustainability-driven research. I believe the materials we design and the processes we use to create them are critical levers for environmental change. My goal is to contribute to the development of renewable, degradable, and environmentally responsible materials that help reshape how we live in harmony with our world.

    <strong>Experience</strong>
    <ul>
      <li> <strong> Eli Lilly & Co. </strong> - Senior Research Associate, Genetic Medicine (2021–2024) Led experimental design and nanoparticle development for CNS-targeted nucleic acid delivery. Built high-throughput platforms and scaled up LNP production with microfluidics and tangential flow filtration. Collaborated across departments and with external partners in a fast-paced, innovative environment.</li>
      <li> <strong> Charles Krug Winery </strong> – Harvest Lab Intern (2020) Supported fermentation experiments and wine chemistry analysis. Learned to translate scientific methods into process-scale applications, and developed a deep appreciation for material transformation through natural processes.</li>
      <li> <strong> Takeda Pharmaceuticals </strong> – Analytical Chemistry Co-op (2019) Worked on small-molecule oncology drug development. Operated analytical instruments and led an ELISA-based project on immune responses to CDN-conjugated liposomes.</li>
      <li> <strong> Northeastern University </strong> – Mabrouk Lab (2019–2021) First-author publication on how undergraduate research transforms scientific thinking. This experience taught me to ask bigger questions and communicate science clearly and effectively.</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Current Focus</strong>
<div style="margin-bottom:8px;"></div>
Right now, I’m focused on building a foundation in sustainable biomaterials through a combination of academic work and hands-on experience. In addition to my research at Eli Lilly, where I developed lipid nanoparticles for nucleic acid delivery, I also worked in the Ackun-Farmmer Lab at Georgia Tech, where I gained experience in polymer synthesis.
<div style="margin-bottom:8px;"></div>
These experiences have shaped my interest in reimagining the entire life cycle of materials, from raw components to degradation, with sustainability in mind. I’m especially excited about the potential of degradable polymers and bio-based systems to help create more circular and environmentally responsible material solutions.
