    I am a biomedical engineering masterâ€™s student at Georgia Tech with experience in polymer and lipid nanoparticle design, formulation, and characterization. I am looking to transition into sustainability-driven research, particularly in the process development of renewable, degradable, and environmentally responsible materials. I am looking to apply my skills in biomaterials design and engineering to create solutions that improve our relationship with the environment through redesigning the materials we use and how we create them.
