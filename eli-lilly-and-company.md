    I spent three years at Eli Lilly and Company as a Senior Research Associate on the Genetic Medicine team in Cambridge, MA. During my time there, I focused on developing and optimizing lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for delivering nucleic acids to the central nervous system. I contributed to the creation of a high-throughput screening platform and worked on scale-up methods using microfluidics and tangential flow filtration. My work spanned from in vitro potency and toxicity testing to in vivo evaluation of LNP distribution in the brain. Beyond the science, I built strong relationships with colleagues across departments and external partners, and deeply valued the collaborative, innovative environment that helped shape my approach to research and teamwork.
